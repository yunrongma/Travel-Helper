# iOS_TravelApp

This Travel Helper App is an iOS app dev project using Swift to help users record different trips, allowing users to upload photos into each trip, mark and connect locations within the map of each trip, and write thoughts for each of their trips.

This project integrated Google Map and Google Places APIs to allow users to track locations, add markers, delete markers, and connect marked locations on Google Map.

It also integrated Apple PhotoKit framework to allow users to select photos into each of the trip and used Apple Localization framework to allow bilingual in English and Chinese based on system setting.
